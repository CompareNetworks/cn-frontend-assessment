# CompareNetworks Assessment Test

Using Angular / pure JS / or your favorite framework please complete the following:

1. Create an image carrousel showcasing Mission bikes.

2. Include a modal for showing information about the individual product if it is clicked.

You can GET the product data from the included json file.


Use the data returned to populate the carrousel with **images**.

Use the data returned to populate the modal with the **image**, **description** and **price** of the product.

Make sure we can run the project using npm run/serve or some other npm command. Feel free to use an npm start project for this (it will depend on the framework you choose).

Try to get as much done in 2-3 hours. The purpose is not to complete the task but to see what your process is.
